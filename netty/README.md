# A template for using java for small one-off projects

### The need
Just writing a small java program using maven but executing it independently without maven can be a f**ing chore.

This template does many things

* Uses maven and includes the most common libraries like guava, apache commons-lang3 and commons-io and Jackson objectmapper for json
* Log4j2 is fully configured. That itself can be quite a chore for a new project.
* A Utils class which includes only "pure" functions. No oop bullshit. reading and writing files, json, etc made easy. Dont leave home without it. Check out the `Timer` class. You can use it to sample throughput.
* When you do `mvn clean package`, all the dependencies, the project jar file and resources go into `target/dependency-jars`. This folder is everything you need to run the program without maven.
* The resources are not packaged in the jar files. Rather they are there as-is in the `dependency-jars` folder so you can just change it and run it. More details below.
* Instead of command line arguments, the main function searches for a `settings.json` in the classpath. So you can provide rich structure to command line arguments instead of flags on the command line
* Heck, I'm even throwing in a nice `.gitignore` and a `README.md` file.
*

### Configure Intellij
The `src/main/resources` folder (henceforth referred to as the `resources` folder) contains config files such as log4j2.xml, etc. It should be possible to change these files and rerun without doing a recompile.

The default maven behaviour makes it impossible because the resource folder gets packaged in the main jar.

 To workaround this, we make some changes in `pom.xml`. We exclude resource folder from getting packaged in the jar and copy the contents directly to `target/`.

 Unfortunately, Intellij starts acting up with this change and needs some hand-holding to make it see the light.

 Go to `file->project structure`. Select `modules` on the left and select the `dependencies` tab on the right. Click the `+` sign to add `Jars or Directories` and select the `resources` folder. In the `choose categories of selected files` dialog box, select `classes` and click `ok`. You'll see the resources directory added to the bottom. That is it. Now all files in `resources` directory are recognized as being in the classpath and everything in the world is happy and gay.
### To compile
````
mvn package
